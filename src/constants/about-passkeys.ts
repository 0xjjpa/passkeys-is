  `Passkeys are a new and innovative form of authentication to enhance the user experience and increase security across all login interfaces. This feature is built on top of the WebAuthn standard, a widespread and well-established web protocol that enables passwordless authentication. WebAuthn is a part of the FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online) project, which aims to make the internet more secure by reducing the reliance on passwords and promoting the use of stronger authentication mechanisms.`,
