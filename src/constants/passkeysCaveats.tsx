    content: <>As with many cryptographic related applications, Passkeys will not be available in insecure contexts. This means that Passkeys will not be available in <PasskeyCode>HTTP</PasskeyCode> contexts, but will be available in <PasskeyCode>HTTPS</PasskeyCode> contexts.

However, <PasskeyCode>navigator.credentials.create</PasskeyCode> takes both <PasskeyCode>name</PasskeyCode> (usually an <PasskeyCode>email</PasskeyCode> or <PasskeyCode>username</PasskeyCode>) and <PasskeyCode>displayName</PasskeyCode> as variables. It is not very evident what are the differences between both and (or when, actually) to use or change which one.</>

    content: <>Passkeys have a <PasskeyCode>id</PasskeyCode> property equal to their <PasskeyCode>rawId</PasskeyCode> value (an <PasskeyCode>ArrayBuffer</PasskeyCode>) encoded in <PasskeyCode>base64</PasskeyCode>. However, the <PasskeyCode>id</PasskeyCode> property will remove the padding of the value (i.e. the <PasskeyCode>=</PasskeyCode> character), making it <i>sometimes</i> a different length than if you were to encode the <PasskeyCode>rawId</PasskeyCode> in <PasskeyCode>bas64</PasskeyCode> yourself. Both values are valid <PasskeyCode>base64</PasskeyCode> encoded strings (i.e., decoders will understand them) but ideally default to using <PasskeyCode>id</PasskeyCode> to avoid these length discrepancies.</>

The key will be then created in the client's Passkey storage. If this action was executed in <PasskeyCode>localhost</PasskeyCode> and there was a key already in that domain, it will be replaced. However, in any other domain, even if the <PasskeyCode>rp</PasskeyCode> property matches, it will not overwrite the existing one but create a new one instead.</>
